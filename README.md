# weather_app

A Flutter app that displays real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API.

Many thanks for reviewing my project — I'm excited to share it with you and hear your feedback!

## Overview of Requirements & Implementation

### Authentication

- Implements a simple authentication flow where users can sign up with a username and password.
- Passwords are **hashed using the `bcrypt` library**.
  - On mobile, user credentials are stored securely using `flutter_secure_storage`.
  - On web, data is stored via `localStorage`.
- The app **persists users** across reloads and supports multiple distinct users.

### Weather Display

- A single weather screen displays:
  - Current time
  - Temperature
  - User’s location
  - Additional weather details
- The background changes dynamically based on the weather description from OpenWeather API.
- Weather updates every minute and reflects real-time location via a `StreamBuilder`.

## Best Practices and Techniques

- **MVVM architecture** separates concerns:
  - `View`: UI logic only
  - `ViewModel`: transforms data for UI
  - `Model`: interacts with APIs/services
- **Singleton pattern** is used throughout to avoid duplicate instances and maintain shared state.
- All dependencies are composed programmatically using utility functions (`lib/utils/composition`).
- **Platform-specific services** are abstracted via interfaces:
  - `SecureStorage` is implemented using `flutter_secure_storage` on mobile and `dart:html` on web.
- **Responsive UI** supports both mobile and web:
  - Uses `LayoutBuilder` for adaptive layouts.
  - Uses conditional imports for logic separation.
- A custom `LoggerService` is injected across all layers for consistent logging.
- On logout:
  - The weather ViewModel is disposed.
  - Singleton instances are cleaned up to avoid memory leaks.

## Getting started

Create a .env.dev file in the config directory and add your OpenWeather API key:

```env
API_KEY="yourAPIKey"

```

To start live services for mobile, run ```make run```, and for chrome run ```make run-chrome```.

> **Note** Chrome blocks network requests to Open Weather API are blocked in the browser
> by CORS policy. 
>
> To preview the Chrome version with dummy services, run ```make prev-chrome```
